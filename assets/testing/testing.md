#### Manual testing

#### User testing
**I want to play a game...**

1. **..that is fun.**
    - 
2. **..that is easy to navigate through.**
    - Clear instructions on how to start the game with the large play ucon and text right under it.
    - Large buttons with clear text that describes the buttons purposes before clicking them.
    - The design of the icons reflect the meaning behind them.

3. **..that doesn't require compeeting agianst the clock.**
    - The timer function only shows the time that has passed since starting the game.

4. **..that has a nice and clean design.**
    - The page layout has a good balance between the different features to highlight where the major focus
    is going to be, but also doesn't hide other functions to make it hard to find them.
    - Contrast between the text and background and with generous space between the different sections and 
    functions.
    - The color scheme is soft for the eyes to look at, with a minimum of color choises as not to overwhelm the player.

5. **..that doesn't play too loud and stressing audio effects on everything I click.**
    - The sound effects are chosen with the intention of not disturbing the player too mutch during playing.
    

6. **..that I can see what my previous score was.**
7. **..that I can come back to and play to get my mind off something. With a mindfulness aspect.**
8. **..that I can play to practise my memory skills.**
9. **..that I can play at night with a darker theme.**
