## User testing
The user testing is based on the user stories from the README.md file.

**I want to play a game...**

1. **..that is fun.**
    - Memory is a classic game that most of us know how to play. The confirmation of getting a matching pair
    makes this game both fun and enjoyable during playing.

2. **..that is easy to navigate through.**
    - Clear instructions on how to start the game with the large play ucon and text right under it.
    - Large buttons with clear text that describes the buttons purposes before clicking them.
    - The design of the icons reflect the meaning behind them.

3. **..that doesn't require compeeting agianst the clock.**
    - The timer function only shows the time that has passed since starting the game.

4. **..that has a nice and clean design.**
    - The page layout has a good balance between the different features to highlight where the major focus
    is going to be, but also doesn't hide other functions to make it hard to find them.
    - Contrast between the text and background and with generous space between the different sections and 
    functions.
    - The color scheme is soft for the eyes to look at, with a minimum of color choises as not to overwhelm the player.

5. **..that doesn't play too loud and stressing audio effects on everything I click.**
    - The sound effects are chosen with the intention of not distracting the player too mutch during playing.
    - The volume is set on the sound effects to not be too loud when playing the game.
    - Sound effects are only added to the main events to the game such as:
        - The card is flipping
        - The card is matching
        - The game is finished
    - The background music is optional to use and can at any time be turned off.

6. **..that I can see what my previous score was.**
    - When replaying the game you can se your previous score in the menu section, right under the timer.

7. **..that I can come back to and play to get my mind off something. With a mindfulness aspect.**
    - This user storie can be referenced with the answears from point number 3-5.

8. **..that I can play to practise my memory skills.**
    - The images used for the memory cards are carefully chosen with a few colors each which makes them easy 
    to interpret and memorize while playing.

9. **..that I can play at night with a darker theme.**
    - With the theme buttons the player can choose what color scheme they want to use when playing the game.
    - The darker theme is more suitable for playing with in darker enviorments because the contrasts are not 
    as strong and thus not as strenuous for the eyes to look at.
