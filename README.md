## UX
### UX goals
The UX goals is to provide the player with a clean and inviting design that will bring a harmonious feeling. 
With its simple design this memory game will be easy for everyone to navigate through without 
annoying effects and cluttered content.

### User stories
I want to play a game...

1. ..that is fun.
2. ..that is easy to navigate through.
3. ..that doesn't require compeeting agianst the clock.
4. ..that has a nice and clean design.
5. ..that doesn't play too loud and stressing audio effects on everything you click.
6. ..that I can come back to and see my old scores.
7. ..that I can come back to and play to get my mind off something. With a mindfulness aspect.
8. ..that I can play to practise my memory skills.
9. ..that I can play at night with a darker theme.

### Design process
1. **Strategy plane** 
My strategy for this game was to offer a fun game experience that lets the player practise their memory skills. 
I also wanted to make the game with a mindfulness twist to it. The strategy plane was based on the user stories above.

2. **Scope plane** 
The main feature was going to be the memory game itself alongside with some other features, such as 
a 'high score list' with locally scored high scores, a timer, smooth sound effects that indicate if you win or loose
and the option to play some jazzy background music (that you also can turn off).
I also wanted the overall theme for the game reflect the mindfulness aspect through the images that I was going
to use. In this stage the images was not decided yet.

3. **Structure plane** 
When the key features was set the structure plane was pretty simple. I was going to have a single page with
all features in it and the keyword simplicity would thereafter guide me through the skeleton plane.

4. **Skeleton plane**
I started sketching out what the layout would be like and got the balance of the page together by dividing 
it into two main sections of the page. The right sektion of the page was going to cover the majority of the
page with the memory game feature. I didn't want the left section to be left out entirely and decided to give
it the space that it needed to provide the information within it as clear as possible.


5. **Surface plane**
- When I knew how I wanted the structure to be I turned to the internet to find free images to use for my game.
I ended up on [Freepic.com](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/potted-plants-set_8271077.htm#page=1&query=plants&position=1)
where I found the pictures of the plants that I ended up using. For me plants represents a sense of calm and
anyone who has plants as a hobby can probably attest that the power of taking care of plants really brings
a mindfulness to both body and soul.
- After that I turned to [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to find colors that would match the theme of the page.
I wanted to use a soft color scheme for the default theme and ended up with the following colors:

- The logo was then made with the technology of [Free Lodge Design](https://www.freelogodesign.org).
- The font that I decided to use throuought the project was [Amatic](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Amatic+SC?query=amatic)

#### Changes I made throuought the project
- Instead of adding the feature of giving the player the option to change background music I decided to replace it
with a questionmark icon in the Menu/Information section to simply provide the player who doesn't know how to
play a memory game with information about how to play.
I'm sure however that most people today know how to play a memory game, but for me it would feel omitted not to 
share that information with the player who wants to play but doesn't know how.

- Some overall text and layout were changed in the overlays to give a better overwiev of the information 
provided in them. I added text under the play button to indicate how to start the game and encourage the 
player to get the background music started.
When the game is finished I decided to add the icon of a winning cup together with the information about how to
play the game again.

### Features
The game page is sectioned into two columns. In the right column the actual memory game is based and in the
left column the logo and Menu/Information section with some other main key features are placed.

1. **The memory game column features**
    - When you first arrive to the page, the memory column where the memory cards are placed has an overlay
    which activates the player to press the play button when they want to start the game.
    - The overlay also contains information that encourages the player to start the background music that will be
    played when pressing the speaker icon in the menu section.
    - When pressing the overlay the overlay disappers and the timer starts counting. The game is started.
    - When clicking the different cards an audio is played to indicate that the card is flipped. When two cards
    match an encouraging sound effect plays.
    - When the player has matched all cards another overlay covers the memory column to indicate that the game
    is finished together with an audio playing.

2. **Menu/Information section**
    - The Menu/Information section includes a logo together with the name of the game and a container that includes a replay
    icon, a speaker icon, a questionmark icon, a moves counter, a timer, the last round time and two theme buttons.

3. **Replay, Speaker and Questionmark Icons**
    - When the replay icon is clicked the page reload. This allows the player to restart the game whenever it's
    needed.
    - When the speaker icon is clicked, the background music starts playing. If the background music is already playing you can
    click on the speaker icon again to stop the music.
    - When the questionmark icon is clicked a modal pops up with information about how to play the game. This modal can be closed
    in two ways, by clicking on the 'X' in the upper right corner, or clicking the 'Close' button on the bottom of the modal.

4. **Moves, Timer and Last Round**
    - The number next to the text 'Moves' indicates how many times the player has made a round of clicking two
    cards in the of the ongoing game round.
    - The timer let's the player know how much time has passed since starting the game. When the game is finished
    the timer is paused.
    - The timestamp next to the 'Last Round' text indicates the time that the player finished the game in the last round of 
    playing. This to encourage the player to try to beat that time in the ongoing round.

5. **Theme Buttons**
    - The two buttons represents a theme each. When the player visits the page the light theme is automatically
    showed which makes the 'Ligh Theme' button disabled.
    When the player click on the 'Dark Theme' button the css style for that theme is switched to. This makes the
    'Dark Theme' button disabled but not the 'Light Theme' button, this to indicate which theme is currently used.

#### Features left to implement
- **Add opportunity to change music during playing.** In the original idea the third icon in the Menu/Information column was
a 'step-forward' icon. This was suppose to include a feature to make it possible to change through different background
songs. However due to lack of time of finding the perfect songs to match the game and the page I decided to
leave this to hopefully add it in the future.
- **Pause button to pause the game while playing.** My mentor suggested that I would add a pause button for the player to be
able to pause the game while playing. This was something I tried to add to the timer function but without a working result,
I just simply couldn't get the function to pause the time as I wanted. So unfortunately I had to skip
that that id√©.

### Testing
#### Manual testing
#### Bugs found
* **Fixed!** The cards wouldn't shuffle when playing the game. Solved the problem by going back and change the cards variable 
value to javascript code instead of jquery that I wrote from the beginning. The problem must have been caused by 
a misunderstanding from my side in the code I wrote.
* **Not fixed yet!** When you click too quick on the next card the card flip audio will sometimes not play. I've tried to solve this 
issue but could not find a solution that would fix this problem. Due to lack of time this is something I will have to
fix in the future and the bug is therefor not fixed right now.
* **Fixed!** The ClearInterval function was not working to stop timer when game is finished. 
I Decided to start from scratch and make a new timer with cleaner code to hopefully get a better understanding of it
and make it work. The new timer that was made worked and I was able to pause it when the game was finished.
* **Fixed!** When testing the game on my iPhone the memory cards wouldn't turn properly when clicking on them. 
This seemed to look fine when I tried the game out in device toolbar in my Chrome browser. 
The feature of flipping the cards did not seem to be supported by Safari browsers so I solved this problem by 
adding a webkit attribute in my css code for the backface visibility.
