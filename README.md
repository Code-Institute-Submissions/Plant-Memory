### Design process
1. Strategy plane: To offer a fun game experience that lets the player practise their memory skills.
2. Scope plane: The maine feature is going to be the memory game itself alongside with some other features, such as 
a high score list with locally scored high scores, sound effects that indicate if you win or loose (with an option 
to turn the sounds completely off) and a pop up when the game is finished.
3. Structure plane: A single page
4. Skeleton plane:
5. Surface plane:

### Testing
#### Manual testing
#### Bugs found
* The cards wouldn't shuffle. Solved the problem by changing the cards variable value to javascript instead of jquery. 
* Delay in sound effects, click sound also doesn't stop play when locked card is clicked. NOT SOLVED YET.
* clearInterval not working to stop timer when game is finished. 
Decided to start from scratch and make a new timer with cleaner code to hopefully get a better understanding of it
and make it work. New timer made with working clearInterval when game is finished.
