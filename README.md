## About

![Screenshot](assets/images/screenshot.png)

Plant Memory is a memory game for everyone to enjoy. The game invites to a harmonious gaming 
experience with a jazzy twist. This memory game does not require any competition ambitions in the player, 
this is simply a memory game that creates peace and harmony in the person who visits the site to play. 
For many, plants represents a sense of calm, and anyone who has plants as a hobby can 
probably certify that the power of having them around really brings a feeling of calm to both 
body and soul. That was how the theme for this game was brought to life. However you don't have to love
plants to be able to enjoy this game, so grab a coup of tea and sit down and enjoy the simple journey of 
this memory game.

## UX
### UX goals
The UX goals is to provide the player with an inviting and responsive design. 
With its simple structure this memory game will be easy for everyone to navigate throughout without 
unclear instructions, annoying audio effects and cluttered content. The main goal is to offer the player a relaxing 
surrounding while practising their memory skills with the interactive features of this game.

#### The main UX goals
* Clean and simple structure so that the player gets a good overwiev when first visiting the page.
* Icons and buttons are large and communicates their purpose clearly.
* The page has a good contrast between text and background.
* The size of the text makes it easy to read.
* The game includes a few but affirmative sound effects that tell the player the progress of the game while playing.
* A soft color scheme.
* Nicely illustrated pictures that fits the page and theme well.
* An overall good feel of the structure and theme together.
* Responsiveness to all devices.

### User stories

1. ..that is fun.
2. ..that is easy to navigate through.
3. ..that doesn't require compeeting agianst the clock.
4. ..that has a nice and clean design.
5. ..that doesn't play too loud and stressing audio effects on everything I click.
6. ..where I can see what my previous score was.
7. ..that I can come back to and play to get my mind off something.
8. ..that I can play to practise my memory skills.
9. ..that I can play at night with a darker theme.

### Design process
1. **Strategy plane** 
My strategy for this game was to offer a fun game experience that lets the player practise their memory skills. 
I also wanted to make the game with a mindfulness and jazzy twist to it. 
The strategy plane was based on the user stories above.

2. **Scope plane** 
The main feature was going to be the memory game itself alongside with some other features, such as 
a 'high score list' with locally scored high scores, a timer, smooth sound effects that indicate if you 
get a match or not
and the option to play some jazzy background music (that you also can turn off).
I also wanted the overall relaxing theme for the game to reflect through the images that I was going
to use for the cards. In this stage the images was not decided yet.

3. **Structure plane** 
When the key features was set the structure plane was pretty simple. I was going to have just a single page with
all the features in it but divided into different sections to make out the most of it and get a nice balance. 
My initial structure is based out of squares (that represents different divs) with information in each that would 
be placed within the main square (the viewport). 
One square would contain the icon and the name of the game, another square would contain the menu with
the interaction functions and then the last square would be the memory game itself with its own overlay 
features.

4. **Skeleton plane**
I started sketching out what the layout would be like and got the balance of the page together by dividing 
it into two main columns of the page. The right column of the page was going to cover the majority of the
page with the memory game feature. In the left section I wanted to add the logo and header in one div together 
with the menu and its different features. This would be the buttons, icons and timer display and locally stored
score for the game.
I didn't want the left section to be left out entirely and decided to give it the space that it needed to 
provide the information within it as clear as possible for the player to easily see and understand it.

5. **Surface plane**
- When I knew how I wanted the structure to be I turned to the internet to find free images to use for my game.
I ended up on [Freepic.com](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/potted-plants-set_8271077.htm#page=1&query=plants&position=1)
where I found the pictures of the plants that I ended up using. (They are credited in the credit section further down)
- After that I turned to [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to find colors that would match the theme of the page.
I wanted to use a soft color scheme for the default theme and ended up with the following colors:

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/images/coolors.png" alt="wireframe 1" width="600px">
</div>

- The logo was then made with the technology of [Free Lodge Design](https://www.freelogodesign.org).
- The font that I decided to use throuought the project was [Amatic](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Amatic+SC?query=amatic)

### Changes I made throuought the project
- In the original id√©a, as you can se in the wireframes. The third icon in the menu section is a 'step-forward' icon.
This was going to be the feature of giving the player the option to change background music while playing.
But I decided to replace it with a questionmark icon to simply provide the players who doesn't know how to
play a memory game with information about how to play instead.
I'm sure however that most people today know how to play a memory game, but for me it would feel omitted not to 
share that information if that would be the case for the person who decides to play this game.

- Some overall text and layout were changed in the overlays to give a better overwiev of the information 
provided in them. I added text under the play button to indicate how to start the game and encourage the 
player to get the background music started.
When the game is finished I decided to add the icon of a winning cup together with the information about how to
play the game again.

- In my original idea I wanted to store a high score in the Menu section of the page. However scoring
in a memory game is not the easiest when you play it by yourself. I therefor decided that I was going to store
the time in the lates round played to make it possible for the player to compare their last game session with 
the ongoing session.
This way, for those who are a little bit more competitive, it would encourage the player with an option to try
to beat that last round time.

## Features
The game page is sectioned into two columns. In the right column the actual memory game is based and in the
left column the logo and menu section with some other main key features are placed.

1. **The right side of the page**
    - On the right side of the page the memory game is located.
    - When you first arrive to the page, the memory section where the memory cards are placed has an overlay
    which activates the player to press the play button when they want to start the game.
    - The overlay also contains information that encourages the player to start the background music that will be
    played when pressing the speaker icon in the menu section.
    - When pressing the overlay the overlay disappers and the timer starts counting. The game is started.
    - When clicking the different cards an audio is played to indicate that the card is flipped. When two cards
    match an encouraging sound effect plays.
    - When the player has matched all cards another overlay covers the memory section to indicate that the game
    is finished together with an audio playing.

<br>
<br>

2. **The left side of the page**
    - The left side includes a logo together with the name of the game and a menu section that includes a replay
    icon, a speaker icon, a questionmark icon, a moves counter, a timer, the last round time and two theme buttons.

<br>
<br>
<div align="center">

</div>
<br>

3. **Replay, Speaker and Questionmark Icons**
    - When the replay icon is clicked the page reload. This allows the player to restart the game whenever it's
    needed.
    - When the speaker icon is clicked, the background music starts playing. While the background music is playing you can
    click on the speaker icon again to stop the music.
    - When the questionmark icon is clicked a modal pops up with information about how to play the game. This modal can be closed
    in two ways, by clicking on the 'X' in the upper right corner, or clicking the 'Close' button on the bottom of the modal.

<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="/assets/images/modal.png" alt="modal" width="400px">
</div>
<br>

4. **Moves, Timer and Last Round**
    - The number next to the text 'Moves' indicates how many times the player has made a round of clicking two
    cards in the ongoing game round.
    - The timer let's the player know how much time has passed since starting the game. When the game is finished
    the timer is paused.
    - The timestamp next to the 'Last Round' text indicates the time that the player finished the game in the last round of 
    playing. This to encourage the player to try to beat that time in the ongoing round. If there's no timestamp
    next to the 'Last Round' text, the player must play one round and then click on the replay icon to see the time of
    the last round that is stored.

<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="/assets/images/moves-timer.png" alt="moves and timer" width="400px">
</div>
<br>

5. **Theme Buttons**
    - The two buttons represents a theme each. When the player visits the page the first time the light theme is automatically
    showed which makes the 'Ligh Theme' button disabled.
    When the player click on the 'Dark Theme' button the css style for that theme is switched to. This makes the
    'Dark Theme' button disabled but not the 'Light Theme' button, this to indicate which theme is currently used.
    Though the light theme is the default theme, both of the themes are locally stored. If the player decides 
    to refresh the page or click on the replay button while playing, the chosen theme from the previous session 
    will still be showing.

### Features left to implement
- **Add opportunity to change music during playing.** 
In the original idea the third icon in the Menu column was
a 'step-forward' icon. This was suppose to include a feature to make it possible to change through different background
songs. However due to lack of time of finding the perfect songs to match the game and the page I decided to
leave this to hopefully add it in the future.

- **Pause button to pause the game while playing.** 
A suggestion was made that I would add a pause button for the player to be
able to pause the game while playing. This was something I tried to add to the timer function but without a working result,
I just simply couldn't get the function to pause the time as I wanted. So unfortunately I had to skip
that id√© and will hopefully try to make it in the future.

- **Pause game if modal is showing**
When the game is started and the player clicks the questionmark icon which shows the 'How to play' modal, the timer
continnues to run. In an ideal memory game the function of pausing the game when the modal pops up would be
implemented, but due to lack of time this is something I will have to implement in the future.
To inform the player I've added text about this in the modal itself.
